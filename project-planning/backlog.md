  - _Given all the project's name and photo when I hover on picture then I should be able to see a pop up box showing a short description about that project_

- [ ] As a user I want to be able to go to the project itself so that I can learn more about how it works

  - _Given the title of the project when I click on it's link then in the new tab, the project should open_

- [ ] As a user I want to be able to go to the project code so that I can read the code used to write the project
